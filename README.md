# Password Generator

Challenge provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/password-generator-app-Mr8CLycqjh)

Your challenge is to build out this password generator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

    Generate a password based on the selected inclusion options
    Copy the generated password to the computer's clipboard
    See a strength rating for their generated password
    View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
    See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

Download the project and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project and help you get set up.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
